README FILE

This project was built on XCode 10, and hence should be compatible with iOS 13.

It has the following Pods:
    pod 'Firebase/Core'
    pod 'Firebase/Firestore'
    pod 'Firebase/Analytics'
    pod 'FirebaseUI/Storage'
    pod 'Firebase/Storage'
    pod 'Firebase/Database'
    
It can be run on a simulator of iOS 13, but requires the correct Google Authentication to access the specific Firesbase path.
